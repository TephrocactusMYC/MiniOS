# Mini OS Kernel (Rust)  
This project was submitted to the **2023 China Undergraduate Computer Systems Ability Competition (Operating Systems Design Track)**.  

In short, it is a **mini operating system kernel implemented from scratch in Rust**, covering the basics of modern operating systems while exploring some additional ideas. The design choices are partly made for **educational purposes**.  

This repository contains a **cleaned-up version** of the original work. Some of the original details can still be found in this [repository](https://gitlab.eduxiji.net/educg-group-17066-1466467/202310055111481-3500) (hosted on a Chinese platform; access from outside China may be slow).
